## Dependencies
The code is tested with `torch 1.6, cuda10.1, debian 11`.  We recommend using anaconda environment: 
```shell
conda create -n chore python=3.7
conda activate chore 
```
Main dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`, install them with 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/xiexh20/CHORE.git && cd CHORE 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Installing other dependencies:
1. psbody-mesh library. see [installation](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh#installation).
2. [igl library](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/). `conda install -c conda-forge igl`
3. [Detectron2](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html) library: 
```shell
python -m pip install detectron2 -f   https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu101/torch1.6/index.html
```
4. [Neural Mesh Renderer](https://github.com/JiangWenPL/multiperson/tree/master/neural_renderer): `pip install external/neural_renderer`
5. [Mesh intersection library](https://github.com/vchoutas/torch-mesh-isect): 
```shell
export CHORE_PATH=${PWD}
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git external/cuda-samples
export CUDA_SAMPLES_INC=${CHORE_PATH}/external/cuda-samples/Common/
git clone https://github.com/vchoutas/torch-mesh-isect external/torch-mesh-isect
cp external/torch-mesh-isect/include/double_vec_ops.h external/torch-mesh-isect/src/
```
Add these lines to `external/torch-mesh-isect/src/bvh.cpp` before `AT_CHECK` is defined ([reference](    https://github.com/vchoutas/torch-mesh-isect/issues/23)):
```cpp
#ifndef AT_CHECK 
#define AT_CHECK TORCH_CHECK 
#endif 
```
finally run `pip install external/torch-mesh-isect/`

## Run demo
Pretrained model can be downloaded from [here](https://nextcloud.mpi-klsb.mpg.de/index.php/s/SatwEeqFnQdBGaF). Please download and extract it in the code directory with: `unzip chore-pretrained.zip -d experiments`

We use the SMPL-H body model, please prepare it from the [official website](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/) and modify `SMPL_MODEL_ROOT` in `PATHS.yml` accordingly.

This demo also requires the object templates from [BEHAVE dataset](http://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/behave/). Download the object templates from [here](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/cvpr22behave/objects.zip) and modify `BEHAVE_PATH` in file `PATHS.yml` accordingly.   

Run demo example with: 
```shell
python demo.py chore-release -s example -on basketball 
```
results will be saved to  `example/000000117377/demo`.
## Training 
Please follow the instructions [here](http://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/behave/license.html) to download the [BEHAVE dataset](http://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/behave/).

After download and unzip, modify the `BEHAVE_PATH` in file `PATHS.yml` accordingly. 
#### Data preprocessing
Specify the root path `PROCESSED_PATH` in file `PATHS.yml` to where you want the processed data to be saved. 

Preprocess one sequence:
```shell
python preprocess/preprocess_scale.py -s [path to one sequence]
```
Alternatively you can run `python preprocess/preprocess_scale.py -a` to process all sequences sequentially. 

#### Train the model 
Specify the number of GPUs by `nproc_per_node` and run the following to start training:
```shell
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --use_env train_launch.py -en chore-release
```
## Testing
For BEHAVE dataset, we test on images from kinect one (k1) and evaluate on images where object is occluded less than 70%. To compute the occlusion ratio, you need to render full object masks. 

Our rendered full object masks can be downloaded [here](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/cvpr22behave/behave-test-object-fullmask.zip). Download and extract them to the *same path* where BEHAVE sequences were extracted.
 

#### Test on BEHAVE test set
After downloading the pretrained model, you can test one sequence from behave data with:
```shell
python recon/recon_fit_behave.py chore-release --save_name chore-release -s [path to one sequence]
```

#### Evaluate 
Run the following to compute errors reported in table 1: 
```shell
python recon/evaluate.py 
```
